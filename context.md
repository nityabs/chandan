The user has provided a directory containing a single HTML file and a single CSS file, which together create a portfolio website for a writer, poet, and digital geek named Chandan Sharma.

The `index.html` file outlines the structure of the portfolio, including a header, a hero section, an about me section, a services section, a media section, a contact form, and a footer. It uses Bootstrap 5 for its layout and includes links to Google Fonts.

The `style.css` file provides the styling for the portfolio, including the typography, colors, and layout. It also includes responsive styles for different screen sizes.

The `images` directory contains all the images used in the portfolio, including a logo, a headshot, company logos, and media icons.

The user wants me to create a context file that summarizes the contents of the directory.

## HTML Structure and Layout

The `index.html` file is structured using semantic HTML5 tags (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) and Bootstrap 5's grid system (`container-fluid`, `container`, `row`, `col-*`).

The page is laid out as follows:

*   **Header**: Contains the logo and navigation bar.
*   **Hero Section**: A three-column layout with a main heading, a rating section, a headshot, and a description.
*   **About Section**: A two-column layout with an "About Me" title and text, followed by a scrolling list of company logos.
*   **Services Section**: A two-row layout of service cards, with alternating column sizes.
*   **Media Section**: A section with a mix of full-width and multi-column images.
*   **Contact Section**: A two-column layout with contact information and a contact form.
*   **CTA Section**: A simple call-to-action section.
*   **Footer**: Contains copyright information and a "back-to-top" button.

The following are the key CSS classes used in the `index.html` file:

*   **Layout**: `container`, `container-fluid`, `row`, `col-*`, `d-flex`, `justify-content-*`, `align-items-*`
